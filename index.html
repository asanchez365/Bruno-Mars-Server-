                wanted to be a solo music artist and did everything he could to make that happen! Bruno Mars had
                released three albums; Doo-Wops & Hooligans, Unorthodox Jukebox, and 24K Magic. Bruno Mars is known for
                his very bipolar songs; one song can be super sad and another song can be very energetic. His songs are
                very meaningful and most people can relate to him. You are missing out in life if you do not listen to
                Bruno Mars!
